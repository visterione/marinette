  "colortype_preview": "What is color type and why is it important\n\nColor type is the natural color range of a person's appearance, which is determined by the color of skin, hair and eyes. Understanding your color type helps you choose the perfect shades for makeup and create a harmonious image...",
  "colortype_full": "What is color type and why is it important\n\nColor type is the natural color range of a person's appearance, which is determined by the combination of skin, hair and eye color. Understanding your color type plays a key role in creating a harmonious image and helps to emphasize natural beauty. Correctly chosen colors can refresh the face, give radiance to the skin and create a complete image.\n\nThe classic theory of color types distinguishes four main types, each of which has its own unique characteristics and recommendations.\n\nSpring color type\nRepresentatives of the spring type are distinguished by a warm, light color . Their skin has a golden or peach undertone, which gives the face a special glow. Hair usually ranges from light blond to golden brown, and eyes can be blue, green, amber, or light brown. Warm, juicy shades work best in makeup: peach and coral blushes, warm pink and coral lipsticks. To create a natural image, you should avoid cold and dark shades, especially black eyeliner, which can look too sharp.\n\nSummer color type\nSummer type is characterized by tenderness and coolness of colors. The skin has a cold pink undertone, the hair is more often ash-blonde or light chestnut, and the eyes can be gray-blue, gray-green or hazel. Muted, cold shades in makeup suit this appearance best. It is recommended to use cold pink and crimson blushes, pink and plum lipsticks, as well as silver and smoky shadows. When choosing cosmetics, be careful with bright warm shades and bronzers, which can create dissonance with the natural color.\n\nAutumn color type\nAutumn type is characterized by warmth and saturation of colors. Representatives of this type have warm, golden or beige skin, hair of red, copper or chestnut shades, and eyes are usually brown, green or amber. Terracotta and brown shades of blush, copper and terracotta-toned lipsticks, as well as golden-brown and olive shadows are best revealed in makeup. Cold pastel tones and silver shades should be avoided, which may look unnatural on a warm complexion.\n\nWinter color type\nWinter type is characterized by contrast and coldness of colors. The skin can be either very light or olive, but always with a cold undertone. The hair is usually dark brown or black, and the eyes can be dark brown, black, or bright blue. Bright, contrasting colors in makeup suit this type best: cool pink and fuchsia blushes, bright red and burgundy lipsticks, as well as rich blue, purple and graphite eye shadows.\n\nHow to determine your color type\n\nDetermining your own color type begins with careful observation of one's appearance. It is important to pay attention to the reaction of the skin to the sun: if you tan quickly, you probably have a warm subtype, and if you burn more often - cold. The color of the veins on your wrist can also be a clue: green veins indicate a warm subtype and blue veins indicate a cool subtype.\n\nYour natural hair color and how your appearance reacts to different colors also provide important clues. Golden tones in the hair and a good look in gold jewelry indicate a warm subtype, while ashen tones and better compatibility with silver indicate a cool one.\n\nPractical tips for using color type knowledge\n\nKnowing your color type is especially useful when choosing cosmetics. When buying new products, be sure to test shades in daylight and pay attention to how they interact with your natural skin tone. Don't be afraid to experiment and create your own color palette that works best for you.\n\nBe aware of seasonal changes: in the summer you can experiment with brighter shades, and in the winter, richer tones often work better. At the same time, it is important to take into account the natural change in skin color throughout the year.\n\nUnderstanding your color type is not a limitation, but a tool that helps emphasize natural beauty and create a harmonious image. With this knowledge, you will be able to more easily choose colors in makeup and clothes that will help you look fresh and natural in any situation.",
