  "colortype_preview": "{TRANSLATE_TO_GEORGIAN: What is a color type and why it matters\n\nColor type is the natural color palette of a person's appearance, determined by skin, hair and eye color. Understanding your color type helps choose perfect shades for makeup and create a harmonious look...}",
  "colortype_full": "{TRANSLATE_TO_GEORGIAN: What is a Color Type and Why It Matters\n\nA color type is the natural color palette of a person's appearance, determined by the combination of skin, hair, and eye color. Understanding your color type plays a crucial role in creating a harmonious look and helps enhance your natural beauty. Properly chosen colors can refresh the face, add radiance to the skin, and create a cohesive appearance.\n\nClassical color type theory identifies four main types, each with its unique characteristics and recommendations.\n\nSpring Color Type\nSpring types are distinguished by their warm, light coloring. Their skin has a golden or peachy undertone that gives the face a special radiance. Hair typically ranges from light blonde to golden brown, while eyes can be blue, green, amber, or light brown. In makeup, warm, juicy shades work best: peach and coral blushes, warm pink and coral lipsticks. For a natural look, it's best to avoid cool and dark shades, especially black eyeliner, which can look too harsh.\n\nSummer Color Type\nThe summer type is characterized by soft and cool colors. The skin has a cool pink undertone, hair is often ash blonde or light brown, and eyes can be grey-blue, grey-green, or hazel. Muted, cool shades in makeup suit this appearance best. It's recommended to use cool pink and raspberry blushes, pink and plum lipsticks, as well as silver and smoky eyeshadows. When choosing cosmetics, be cautious with bright warm shades and bronzers, which can create disharmony with the natural coloring.\n\nAutumn Color Type\nThe autumn type stands out with warmth and richness of colors. People of this type have warm, golden, or beige skin, hair in red, copper, or chestnut shades, and usually brown, green, or amber eyes. In makeup, terracotta and brown blushes, copper and terracotta lipsticks, and golden-brown and olive eyeshadows work best. Avoid cool pastel tones and silver shades, which can look unnatural against warm coloring.\n\nWinter Color Type\nThe winter type is characterized by contrast and coolness of colors. The skin can be either very light or olive but always has a cool undertone. Hair is usually dark brown or black, and eyes can be dark brown, black, or bright blue. This type looks best with bright, contrasting colors in makeup: cool pink and fuchsia blushes, bright red and burgundy lipsticks, as well as rich blue, purple, and graphite eyeshadows.\n\nHow to Determine Your Color Type\n\nDetermining your color type begins with careful observation of your appearance. It's important to notice how your skin reacts to sun exposure: if you tan easily, you likely have a warm undertone, while if you tend to burn, you probably have a cool undertone. The color of veins at your wrist can also provide clues: green veins indicate a warm undertone, while blue veins suggest a cool one.\n\nYour natural hair color and how your appearance responds to different colors also provide important hints. Golden highlights in your hair and looking good in gold jewelry suggest a warm undertone, while ashy tones and better compatibility with silver indicate a cool undertone.\n\nPractical Tips for Using Color Type Knowledge\n\nUnderstanding your color type is particularly useful when choosing cosmetics. When purchasing new products, always test shades in natural daylight and pay attention to how they interact with your natural skin tone. Don't be afraid to experiment and create your own color palette that works best for you.\n\nRemember seasonal changes: in summer, you can be bolder with brighter shades, while in winter, more saturated tones often work better. It's important to consider the natural change in skin color throughout the year.\n\nUnderstanding your color type isn't a limitation but rather a tool that helps enhance your natural beauty and create a harmonious look. With this knowledge, you can more easily select colors in makeup and clothing that will help you look fresh and natural in any situation.}",

  "face_shape_full": "{TRANSLATE_TO_GEORGIAN: Face Shapes: Secrets of Harmonious Proportions\n\nFace shape is one of the key factors in creating an individual look. Understanding your face shape helps choose the right hairstyle, makeup, and jewelry that will enhance your natural beauty and minimize any imperfections.\n\nMain Face Shapes\n\nOval Shape\nConsidered the ideal face shape due to balanced proportions: face length is approximately one and a half times the width, with softly defined cheekbones. Those with oval faces suit almost any makeup and hairstyle. The main task is to emphasize the natural harmony of features.\n\nRound Shape\nCharacterized by equal length and width of the face, soft angles, and full cheeks. The main makeup goal is to visually elongate the face. This can be achieved through proper contouring on the sides of the face and emphasis on the eyes. Hairstyles with volume at the crown and asymmetrical cuts work best.\n\nSquare Shape\nDistinguished by a wide jawline and defined angles. In makeup, it's important to soften angles using blended contouring and circular motions when applying blush. Hairstyles with soft lines and light curls are recommended to soften facial features.\n\nHeart Shape\nHas a wide forehead that narrows to the chin, forming a heart shape. Makeup should visually widen the lower part of the face and soften the transition from the wide forehead. Hairstyles with volume at the bottom and soft bangs work best.\n\nDiamond Shape\nCharacterized by prominent cheekbones with a narrow forehead and chin. Makeup should focus on balancing proportions: highlighting the forehead and chin, soft contouring of cheekbones. Hairstyles with volume in the temple area look best.\n\nRectangle Shape\nHas elongated proportions with approximately equal width of forehead, cheekbones, and jaw. In makeup, it's important to visually shorten the face length and add softness to features. Hairstyles with light waves and bangs work well.\n\nHow to Determine Your Face Shape\n\n1. Measuring Proportions\n• Take a front-facing photo in even lighting\n• Measure the width of your forehead, cheekbones, and chin\n• Measure the length from hairline to chin\n\n2. Analyzing Facial Features\n• Note jaw angles (sharp or soft)\n• Evaluate the ratio of upper and lower face\n• Analyze cheekbone width\n\n3. Observing Shadows\n• In good lighting, pay attention to facial shadows\n• They help better see relief and proportions\n\nMakeup Tips for Different Face Shapes\n\nUniversal Recommendations\n• Start with a quality makeup base\n• Use contouring to correct shape\n• Pay attention to symmetry when applying makeup\n\nContouring\n• Darker shades visually reduce facial areas\n• Lighter shades bring areas forward and enlarge them\n• Blend products thoroughly for a natural effect\n\nBlush\n• Proper blush placement can change face shape perception\n• Diagonal application elongates the face\n• Circular application softens features\n\nHighlighter\n• Use it to accent desired areas\n• Apply to the highest points of the face\n• Don't overdo it for natural glow\n\nAdditional Recommendations\n\n1. Eyebrow Shape\n• Choose eyebrow shape according to face shape\n• Soft lines soften features\n• Sharp angles can make the face more structured\n\n2. Makeup Accents\n• Choose what to emphasize: eyes or lips\n• Consider proportions when creating accents\n• Maintain balance in makeup\n\n3. Feature Correction\n• Use correction techniques for nose, eyes, lips\n• Pay attention to symmetry\n• Work with natural features, not against them\n\nUnderstanding your face shape and knowing how to work with it is key to creating a harmonious look. Remember that these recommendations are guidelines, not strict rules. Experiment, find what works for you, and don't be afraid to break from standards. Your uniqueness is your advantage.}",
